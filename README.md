In week 1, we will use TensorFlow and Keras API to build and analyze
the accuracy of training vs validation dataset. The credits of dataset goes to <a href="www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a>.

# Week 2

In week 2, OpenCV and TensorFlow API is used to predict threat objects on custom made dataset. 
A part of dataset credits goes to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
